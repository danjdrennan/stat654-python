# Accessing Python Codes

**Dan Drennan**

**01 February 2022**

This is a short doc to announce where files can be downloaded.
You'll see all materials produced for the course on Canvas.
For Python codes, I will also be uploading all notebooks, scripts, and other files to
<https://github.com/danjdrennan/stat654-python>.
If you're familiar with the version control system `git` and GitHub
(or if you're curious to learn those tools, which is good prep for industry jobs in stats/data science),
then you may find this useful.
If you've installed Git on your machine, you can download the repository from the internet once and all
subsequent downloads from the site can be done simply by

1. Navigating to the folder storing the repository

2. Opening a Git terminal (can be done in Windows terminal, bash, or the MAC equivalent)

3. Typing `git pull`

Following those three steps, Git will automatically download all files I've uploaded (or updated) to your machine.
All files will also be uploaded to Canvas as they are updated, so you can download these materials in whatever way
is most comfortable for you.
